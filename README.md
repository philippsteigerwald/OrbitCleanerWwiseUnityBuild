OrbitCleaner was designed to be used in the study for my Masterthesis. Exploring the Impact of Action Audio Games on Creativity: Perspectives in Sonic Thinking. If you are interested in the study head to the pdf in OrbitCleaner_Game Folder.

OrbitCleaner runs on Windows only and can be found in \OrbitCleaner_Game\OrbitCleaner1.exe

When you start the game you have to give your consent because this game was developed to be used in a study setting. Once you give your consent you can proceed. You can either choose group 1 or group 2. Group 1 will start the action game, group 2 will start the non-action game. Once you finish either, you will automatically copy your generated ID to the the clipboard and upon restarting, the version that wasnt played yet will start. Otherwise you can always empty your clipboard and then choose the version you would like to play. Either close your eyes or activate blind mode. Headphones are required.

A report is created once you finish all 5 levels. You can look at your stats when navigating to:

\OrbitCleaner_Game\OrbitCleaner1_Data\Report

Use "ESC" to quit.

Enjoy!
