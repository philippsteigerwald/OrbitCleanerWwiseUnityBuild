OrbitCleaner is an Audiogame (played blindfolded) and was designed to be used in the study for my Masterthesis - Exploring the Impact of Action Audio Games on Creativity: Perspectives in Sonic Thinking. For more information on the development and sound design decisions head to the Masterthesis.pdf in the OrbitCleaner_Game folder.

For representation purposes a screenshot of the tutorial and a video of stage 5 of OrbitCleaner are attached below. However, the screen is rendered black in the study as the game is specfically ment to be played with headphones only. You are supposed to locate the objects and identifiy them by their sound and then use the corresponding action beam to neutralize them before they hit you.

OrbitCleaner runs on Windows and can be found in \OrbitCleaner_Game\OrbitCleaner1.exe

When you start the game you have to give your consent because this game was developed to be used in a study setting. Once you give your consent you can proceed. You can either choose group 1 or group 2. Group 1 will start the action game, group 2 will start the non-action game. Once you finish either, you will automatically copy your generated ID to the the clipboard and upon restarting, the version that wasnt played yet will start. Otherwise you can always empty your clipboard and then choose the version you would like to play. Either close your eyes or activate blind mode. Headphones are required.

A report is created once you finish all 5 levels. You can look at your stats when navigating to:

\OrbitCleaner_Game\OrbitCleaner1_Data\Report

Use "ESC" to quit.

Enjoy!
